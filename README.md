# Electonic-Voting-Machine-using-Arduino.UNO

This project implements a basic electronic voting system using an Arduino UNO, Oled display, three LEDs, and pushbuttons. It requires a login password for access and offers two main functions: voting and viewing results. Users can cast votes for one of three candidates—Virat, Dhoni, or Sachin—using the pushbuttons. The system confirms each vote and allows users to view the total votes and winner by re-entering the login password. The project is ideal for those looking to create a simple, secure voting mechanism with Arduino.
